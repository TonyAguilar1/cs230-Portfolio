Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
  Our client "The Gaming Room" tasked us with scaling their operation from their current web application to other operating platforms such as apple,linux as well as windows. 
  As their consulting fimr, we would help them set up the environment in which their game app would be the best fit.


What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

  My strong suit in this project was the recommendation that I was able to provide to the client in terms of what was their best
  solution and what would allow them to scale with minimal investment as a serverless first launch. 

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

  It allowed for a visual representation on how the different portions of the program worked cohesively and truly gave
  me an insight on how perhaps even developing micro-services might look on a much smaller scale. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?  
  I would like to improve my project one submission considering there was alot of errors in my logic and assumtion and therefore earned the lowest grade. 
  I would think more critically and re-read the instructions to be able to approach it from a different perspective. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  It is really important because it allows for a quicker launch considering there is no time wasted on features that are not required while it allows
  flexibility on tasks or roadblocks that might come up. It also prevents the client from overspending and the team under-delivering.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

  I really enjoyed taking each tasks on its own premise and then circling back to see how the other parts of the pie fit. Sometimes I am not a tactful person
  but allowing my self to work on one tasks at a time makes for less redundancy and less work overall.
